These include any changes to the reporting entity's business, net settlement of any contracts, changes in market conditions, and other relevant factors. This means that if there are significant changes in the business environment or market conditions that could affect the likelihood of physical delivery, these should be taken into account. For example, if a company's business model has changed to focus more on digital products, this could reduce the probability of physical delivery. Similarly, if market conditions have changed such that physical delivery becomes less feasible or desirable, this should also be factored into the evaluation. The net settlement of any contracts could also impact the probability of physical delivery. For instance, if a company has settled a large number of contracts net, this could indicate that physical delivery is less likely.

Secondly, this assessment should also be performed on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the contract.

An embedded derivative can alter net interest payments based on changes in a stock price index (or another non-interest-rate index) by causing the cash flows to change in response to changes in the underlying index. This is not directly addressed in paragraph 815-15-25-26 of GAAP, which focuses on interest rate indexes.
